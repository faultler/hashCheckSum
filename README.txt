hashCheckSum, to run the existing script md5deep through a command prompt (designed for a MS Windows system). 
This repository will house a .bat file that will execute a Python 3.6 program.
This program will request a directory path from the user. The user will need to direct to the main folder of the data set to be translated.
Once the directory path has been submitted, the program will begin by creating a list of the expected 24 subdirectories of the main directory.
Each of these subdirectories' paths' will be sent as part of a string input to a MS command prompt to run the md5deep executable.
